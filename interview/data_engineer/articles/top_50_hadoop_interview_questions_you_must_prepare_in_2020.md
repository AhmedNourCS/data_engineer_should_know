|Data Types               |RDBMS relies on the structured data and the schema of the data is always known.|Any kind of data can be stored into Hadoop i.e. Be it structured, unstructured or semi-structured.|
|Processing               |RDBMS provides limited or no processing capabilities.|Hadoop allows us to process the data which is distributed across the cluster in a parallel fashion.|
|Schema on Read Vs. Write |RDBMS is based on ‘schema on write’ where schema validation is done before loading the data.|On the contrary, Hadoop follows the schema on read policy.|
|Read/Write Speed         |In RDBMS, reads are fast because the schema of the data is already known.|The writes are fast in HDFS because no schema validation happens during HDFS write.|
